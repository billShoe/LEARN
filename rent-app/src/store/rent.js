    desc: 'Have you ever seen the movie Shrek? And if so--have you ever thought: "Wow, I would love to live out in the middle of nowhere with a donkey*?" Well, now you can! Except, replace a donkey with an abundance of squash. Here at Squash Flats, you will wonder how you could ever go more than a day without such a vital vegetable (AKA A GOURD ACCORDING TO JUSTIN). Take peaceful walks to nowhere, thrive in the pure wilderness (which is five miles out of Akron, Ohion), and never eat anything besides our delicious squash ever again. Inspired by Veggie Tales. You, too, could join our community--which consists of Farmer Dale and his cows. LETTUCE find your dream shack today. Sponsored by Dwayne the Rock Johnson. *Disclaimer: Donkey not included.'
