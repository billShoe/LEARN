        <h1>Justin</h1>
        <p>Hi. My name is Justin Pi, and I moved here from NorCal one month ago. I moved down here for this boot camp! I live down town, on Cortez Hill, which is a fifteen minute walk away. I went to community college for biology and was initially goind to apply for transfer to UCSD. SO I guess I got here one way or another...</p>
        <p>I grew up in Taiwan, which is a tiny island off the coast of China (and is definitly a country). I attended middle and highschool in a tiny international school.</p>
